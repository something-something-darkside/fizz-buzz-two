# fizz-buzz-two

### Specification

Same as fizz-buzz but using Java 8 features.  
Write a class that produces the following for any contiguous range of integers:
   * the number
   * 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
   * 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
   * 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15
   * If the number contains a three you must output the text 'lucky'. This overrides any existing behaviour

Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.

e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

`1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz`
